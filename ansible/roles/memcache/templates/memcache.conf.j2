# Memcached configuration file

# Listen on the IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
# This means Memcached will only accept connections from the local machine.
# If you need to accept connections from other machines, change this to a public IP or 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces.
-l 127.0.0.1

# Specify the port number Memcached will listen on
# Default port is 11211, but you can change it if needed.
-p 11211

# Set the amount of memory (in MB) allocated for caching
# This example sets 64 MB of memory for Memcached. Adjust this value based on your system's available RAM.
-m 64

# Set the maximum number of simultaneous connections
# This example allows up to 1024 connections. Increase this value for higher concurrency needs.
-c 1024

# Define the number of threads Memcached will use
# In this case, Memcached will use 4 threads. Adjust this based on the number of CPU cores.
-t 4

# Set the user account Memcached runs as
# This example uses the 'memcache' user for better security. Ensure this user exists or change to an appropriate user.
-u memcache
